# Project Management System

This is a simple Project Management System implemented using Java 17 and Spring Boot. 

It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing projects.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 installed on your system
- Maven for dependency management
- Postman or similar tool for API testing

### Steps to Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/yamini20-01/ProjectManagement.git

2. Navigate to the project directory in IntelliJ IDEA projectmanagement:

   cd projectmanagement
   
3. Build the project using Maven:

   mvn clean install
   
4. Run the Application:

   The application will start on port 8080 by default.
   

### Project Structure

The project follows a typical Spring Boot application structure with the following packages:

com.sirma.projectmanagement.controller: Contains REST API controllers.

com.sirma.projectmanagement.entity: Contains entity classes representing the data model.

com.sirma.projectmanagement.repository: Contains Spring Data JPA repositories.

com.sirma.projectmanagement.service: Contains service classes for business logic.

### REST API Endpoints
The following REST API endpoints are available:

POST /projects: Create a new project.

GET /projects: Retrieve all projects.

GET /projects/{id}: Retrieve a project by ID.

PUT /projects/{id}: Update an existing project.

DELETE /projects/{id}: Delete a project by ID.

Refer to the API documentation or use tools like Postman for detailed usage instructions .


## Project Technologies and Tools

- **Java**: Programming language used for application development.
 
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. It simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
 
- **Spring Data JPA**: Part of the larger Spring Data family, it provides an abstraction over data access technologies like JPA, allowing for easier database interaction.
 
- **H2 Database**: An in-memory database used for data storage and management during development.
 
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and building the project.
 
- **Postman**: API development environment used for testing RESTful APIs.
 
- **JUnit 5**: Testing framework for unit testing Java applications.
 
- **Mockito**: Mocking framework used for testing in Java applications.
 
- **MockMvc**: Spring Framework's testing support for web applications, used for integration testing of Spring MVC controllers.
 

## Project Dependencies

- **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa**: Starter for using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
 
- **spring-boot-starter-web**: Starter for building web applications using Spring MVC.
 
- **h2**: Dependency for the H2 in-memory database.
 
- **lombok**: Library for reducing boilerplate code in Java applications, such as getter/setter methods, constructors, and more.
 
- **spring-boot-starter-test**: Starter for testing Spring Boot applications, including support for JUnit and Mockito.
 
- **jakarta.validation-api**: Jakarta Bean Validation API for data validation.
 
- **junit-jupiter-api**: JUnit 5 API for unit testing.
 
- **mockito-core**: Core Mockito library for mocking objects and behavior in tests.
 
- **mockito-junit-jupiter**: Mockito extension for integration with JUnit 5.
 
- **spring-boot-test-autoconfigure**: Auto-configuration support for Spring Boot tests.
 
- **spring-test**: Spring Framework's testing support.
 
- **junit**: JUnit library for unit testing.
 

These technologies, tools, and dependencies contribute to the development, testing, and maintenance of the Spring Boot project, ensuring robustness, reliability, and ease of development.


### Testing
The application includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness of its functionalities. You can run the tests using Maven:

mvn test
