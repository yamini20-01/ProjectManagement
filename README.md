# Project Management System

This is a simple Project Management System implemented using Java 17 and Spring Boot. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing projects.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 installed on your system
- Maven for dependency management
- Postman or similar tool for API testing

### Steps to Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/yamini20-01/ProjectManagement.git

2. Navigate to the project directory in IntelliJ IDEA projectmanagement:

   cd projectmanagement
   
4. Build the project using Maven:

   mvn clean install
   
6. Run the Application:

   The application will start on port 8080 by default.
   

### Project Structure
The project follows a typical Spring Boot application structure with the following packages:

com.example.projectmanagement.controllers: Contains REST API controllers.
com.example.projectmanagement.models: Contains entity classes representing the data model.
com.example.projectmanagement.repositories: Contains Spring Data JPA repositories.
com.example.projectmanagement.services: Contains service classes for business logic.

### REST API Endpoints
The following REST API endpoints are available:

POST /projects: Create a new project.

GET /projects: Retrieve all projects.

GET /projects/{id}: Retrieve a project by ID.

PUT /projects/{id}: Update an existing project.

DELETE /projects/{id}: Delete a project by ID.

Refer to the API documentation or use tools like Postman for detailed usage instructions .

### Testing
The application includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness of its functionalities. You can run the tests using Maven:

mvn test
